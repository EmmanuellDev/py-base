# Arithmetic Operators
#Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod, Exponent, F_Div

x = 2
y = 3

# print ("Addition : ", x + y)
# print ("Subtraction : ", x - y)
# print ("Multiplication : ", x * y)
# print ("Division : ", x / y)
# print ("Modulus : ", x % y)
# print ("Exponent : ", x ** y)
# print ("Floor Division : ", x // y)

# Comparison Operator
# equal to, not equal to, greater than, lesser than. greater than or equal to, lesser than or equal to

# print ( x==y )
# print ( x!=y )
# print ( x>y )
# print ( x<y )
# print ( x>=y )
# print ( x<=y )


# # Logical Operators
# # AND, OR, NOT

# print (x > 1 and y < 10)
# print (x > 10 or y < 4)
# print (not(x==2))


# # Identity Operator
# # is, is not

# print (x is y)
# print (x is not y)

# # Membership Operator
# # in, not in

# c = [2,4,6]
# d = [2,4,6]
# print (2 in c)
# print (6 not in d)


# Bitwise Operator
#AND, OR, XOR, NOT, left shift, right shift

# p = 10
# q = 4
# print (p & q)
# print (p | q)
# print (p ^ q)
# print (~p)
# print (p >> 2)
# print (p << 2)
